# 🔥 EMBER

**E**ngine **M**odel-Based **B**arrier-Enhanced **R**einforcement Learning

EMBER is a research framework for **safe and adaptive control of internal combustion engines** using **reinforcement learning (RL)** with **Control Barrier Functions (CBFs)**.  
It is designed to enable learning-based control while **provably enforcing safety constraints**, with a focus on **low-temperature combustion (LTC)** regimes.
